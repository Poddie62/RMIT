This project consists of the development of an App that can be used for Australians to invest their own retirement funds in a flexible and informed way. 
Current Superannuation legislation allows for people to invest their own super, either through a company of a self-managed fund. Yet extremely few people choose to do this, trusting in a company to invest it for them. The finished app will allow educated customers to invest their own super money where they see fit.
