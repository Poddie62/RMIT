# Tim's RMIT Thing 
This project consists of the development of an App that can be used for Australians to invest their own retirement funds in a flexible and informed way. 
Current Superannuation legislation allows for people to invest their own super, either through a company of a self-managed fund. Yet extremely few people choose to do this, trusting in a company to invest it for them. The finished app will allow educated customers to invest their own super money where they see fit.

Motivation – 100 words
Superannuation has in the past been largely ignored by many Australians. It is a silent necessity of all workers wages, and contains billions in retirement savings that will one day be essential to each individual upon their retirement. Yet few people take an active interest in understanding or investing the money they will live off when they stop working. This project will attempt to increase the control and awareness Australians have over their funds in Super, and allow them to make their own investment choices. 
In my own current role ition has in the past been largely ignored by many Australians. It is a silent necessity of all workers wages, and contains billions in the superannuation industry, I commonly interact with customers who have little awareness of their superannuation. This often leads to them having too little, too late, and relying on the aged pension or family to support themselves. I hope that this app when launched will be able to help Australians stay informed about their retirement choices. 
Simply put, the primary aim of this project is to allow Australians to have more control over their money, and therefore their future.

Description 
The product to be launched is an app based investment platform that functions for superannuation. It would allow the common Australian with a minimum of $5000 in super to be able to invest their own money as they prefer, in a vast range of investment options. 

The app would act similarly to a share based trading platform, enabling an individual to pick and choose where they wanted their money to move into. There will also be an emphasis on the flexibility of investing, with options consisting of Shares, Exchange traded funds, and term deposits available. Customers could choose on a daily basis where they wanted to direct their money. 
For the less active or more cautious investor, there would also be the traditional option of placing the funds under the supervision of a financial advisory firm. This is what is currently done in the vast majority of super companies, and requires very little effort or interaction on the part of the member. How this app differs in this respect, is that the financial investment firm would make transparent investments that would be visible each day to each person. 
In an environment where more and more Australians are turning away from large financial institutions out of mistrust, total transparency is essential. Allowing each person to see where their money actually is on an updated daily basis would do a lot to instil trust in an organisation handling it. 

Typically, those people who wanted more flexibility in super and wanted to get out of larger companies would be forced to start their own Self-Managed Superfunds. While this works well for small business owners and people looking to invest in their own assets, it has several drawbacks that this app can rectify. Primarily, any SMSF requires a large amount of hands on management around investing and self-regulation of the invested funds. Often, SMFS require an accountant or advisor to complete the paperwork, further driving up the cost of maintaining these funds. This App is designed to have the flexibility of an SMSF, with drastically lowered costs and minimal paperwork. 
The fees charged on each account will be twofold. A flat dollar based account fee that is universal across all customers. This fee will be charged on a yearly basis and aim to cover the basic administrative costs of running the app. The second fee will be deducted as a percentage of each trade or transaction that takes place on the app. I anticipate this being a huge source of potential revenue, as day traders and financial investment firms make changes quite often. 
The exact fee amounts themselves will be confirmed when an estimation of the overhead in maintaining the app can be confirmed. 
Maintenance costs of the app will be kept to a minimum, as all data and information is stored online. 
An automated Chabot will be available to all customers around the clock, with the goal to answer FAQ about the app and its functionality. For more technical support, a small inbound contact centre will operate to take phone calls and emails from all customers.
In summary, this project is designed to incorporate flexibility and transparency into an accessible online platform for people to manage their money. I hope that it will not only prove to be a useful tool for people to maximise their retirement savings, but also promote financial education in the community at large. 

Tools and technologies and skills required – 200 words 

The greatest hardware requirement will come from the contact centre team. This team who will answer calls and receive emails will require an array of technological devices to stay up to date. They will as a minimum require an office location with a strong internet connection. Each person must have their own computer and phone, along with an assigned working space. However, to manage costs, I would recommend using an external contracted company to oversee the contact centre. The servers containing the app information must also be rented from a large service providing company. 
In terms of software, the extensions into share trading and investment can be imported from a large share trading platform. This will save the need of attempting to design a share trading app from scratch. The main app will be designed using the App development tool Alpha Anywhere. I have selected this technology as it flexible, reliable and has a reputation for allowing rapid development. It’s main appeal to me is the minimal coding required, and can how it can be used by both the front and back end of development and deployment. 
The greatest drawback in developing this application will be my own inexperience in coding and making applications. While I have a good grasp of the content, I do not understand much about the back end creation of websites or apps. I will either need to advance my skillset and knowledge considerably on this topic, or hire someone who knows what they are doing.  

Outcome and problems faced:

As this project relies on a high level of member engagement or interest for it to be truly successful, it faces several real challenges. Most notably that we will be enabling people with very little experience to invest their own retirement funds. With increasingly volatile markets, customers face the risk of making uninformed decisions that could cause a loss of their funds. Additionally, the complexity and many steps in investing in an informed manner are likely to discourage people from attempting to get involved. 
To combat both of these issues, the project requires a marketing campaign and educational guide to explain how it works while also attracting awareness. 
As the project touches on so many financial sectors, a heavy emphasis on adherence to regulations and laws must be observed in its development. All parts of the app and what we project to each customer should be compliant, and ethically in line with the current legal standards. These standards can only be maintained with informed oversight of all parts of the App experienced individuals. 
Regardless of it profitability, this project will be considered successful if it can heighten awareness around superannuation, and provide an educational platform for people to use. I believe that increasing Australians interest in superannuation will make more financially aware, and more prepared for retirement.
