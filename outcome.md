Outcome and Problems faced 

As this project relies on a high level of member engagement or interest for it to be truly successful, it faces several real challenges. Most notably that we will be enabling people with very little experience to invest their own retirement funds. With increasingly volatile markets, customers face the risk of making uninformed decisions that could cause a loss of their funds. Additionally, the complexity and many steps in investing in an informed manner are likely to discourage people from attempting to get involved. 
To combat both of these issues, the project requires a marketing campaign and educational guide to explain how it works while also attracting awareness. 
As the project touches on so many financial sectors, a heavy emphasis on adherence to regulations and laws must be observed in its development. All parts of the app and what we project to each customer should be compliant, and ethically in line with the current legal standards. These standards can only be maintained with informed oversight of all parts of the App experienced individuals. 
Regardless of it profitability, this project will be considered successful if it can heighten awareness around superannuation, and provide an educational platform for people to use. I believe that increasing Australians interest in superannuation will make more financially aware, and more prepared for retirement.
